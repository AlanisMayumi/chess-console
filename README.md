The Chess Console app is a console-based application developed in C# that simulates a chess game. It allows players to make moves, validate them according to chess rules, and track the game state. The project is designed for those who enjoy chess and appreciate minimalistic, text-based interfaces. Whether you're practicing programming or playing chess without a graphical interface, this app offers a straightforward and engaging experience.
